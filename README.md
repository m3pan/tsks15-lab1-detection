## TSKS15 Computer Laboratory Exercise 1 â€“ Detection

The objective of this computer project is to implement a classifier that can detect music melodies. More specifically, the task of the classifier is to take a noisy signal produced by a signal generator and determine which melody, among a predetermined set of melodies, this signal contains. 

You will implement two different classifiers based on different signal models, and use Monte- Carlo simulation to analyze how these classifiers perform for different noise levels.
